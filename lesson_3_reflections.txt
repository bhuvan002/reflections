When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I want to share my code with other or make it public.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
  stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I'm making a different set of changes on the same branch (eg. master), I would
want to manually decided when to pull so that there is no conflict, etc

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

We can keep track of the diff between the last know state of the remote and and local master.
Also, it helps in resolving conflicts when we pull (or fetch + merge)


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and
  what would be harder?

I could probably use dropbox/google docs. Keeping track of changes with the summary and
making sure that there are no conflicts would be difficult.
