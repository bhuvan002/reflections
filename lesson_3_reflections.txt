When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I want to share my code with other or make it public.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
  stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I'm making a different set of changes on the same branch (eg. master), I would
want to manually decided when to pull so that there is no conflict, etc
